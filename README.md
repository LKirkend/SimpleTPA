# CG SimpleTPA
CG Simple TPA is a simple teleport plugin to allow players to teleport to each other.

This plugin has no config, no prefixes, no setting up, and no hassle. Just install and go. 

Note: this is my first public and open-source plugin so expect werid formatting and werid placement in the source-code. I'm open to feedback!
